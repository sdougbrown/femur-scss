# Femur

Femur is an opinionated enhancement to [Skeleton-Sass](https://github.com/WhatsNewSaes/Skeleton-Sass), which is the (un)official Sass version of [Dave Gamache's](https://twitter.com/dhg) [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) Framework.

-----

Skeleton is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Femur ... kind of makes things more complicated. (In a good way though!)

## Getting started

### Install Global Dependancies
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [bower](http://bower.io): `[sudo] npm install bower -g`
  * [grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com): `[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli`

### Install Local Dependancies
  * [Download zip](https://github.com/sdougbrown/femur-scss/archive/master.zip), [clone the repo](github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/sdougbrown/femur-scss) or `bower install femur-scss` from your terminal
  * cd to project folder
  * run `[sudo] npm install` (first time users)
  * run `grunt` (to watch and compile sass files)

### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, ~~Normalize CSS as a reset,~~ a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

### Contributions
This is a fork of the original work.  I'm happy to accept input, but I've primarially made adjustments to fit my own style and preferences, so I'm going to have to agree with you philosophically in order to merge your PR. :)

### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid.

Femur adjusts some of the class names utilized with a more opinionated style, but trys to stay just as small so that it gets out of your way.

- Minified, it's less than a kb
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
